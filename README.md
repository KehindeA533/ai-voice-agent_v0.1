# AI Voice Agent - Research Prototype

This is the first implementation of an AI voice bot designed for research purposes. This version will explore how users interact with a general AI voice agent. Users will engage in conversation with a witty Jamaican AI agent, providing insights into user behavior and interaction patterns.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend Server
Before running the frontend, start the backend server by executing:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch `server.js`, which handles communication with the OpenAI API.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view request.

### 2. Start the Frontend
Once the backend is running, start the frontend using:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to interact with the AI voice agent.

### 3. Set Up Your OpenAI API Key
Ensure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` configured in the `.env` file before running the project.
