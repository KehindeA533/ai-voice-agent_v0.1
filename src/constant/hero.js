    description: `Hi, My name is Kehinde!
    I'm a software developer building AI voice agents for businesses. 
    Think of this AI like Jarvis from Iron Man—minus internet access (for now). This is a prototype, and more features are coming soon. 
    I’d love your feedback—let me know what features you'd like to see below. 
    AI can make mistakes, so please double-check any responses.`,
